Background
The increasing reliance on phone-based and mobile app interactions for essential services has opened new avenues for both convenience and fraud. Address changes keyed over the phone and mobile app registrations linked to unique user IDs (UIDs) are two critical areas prone to fraudulent activities. Fraudsters exploit these channels to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, redirect communications, and conduct Account Takeover (ATO) attacks. Such fraudulent activities can lead to significant financial losses and compromise customer trust. 
Therefore, there is a pressing need for a robust mechanism to detect, assess, and mitigate these risks, ensuring the security and integrity of these processes.


Intent
This consolidated report aims to enhance the organization's ability to detect and prevent fraudulent activities associated with address changes requested over the phone and mobile app registrations linked to UIDs. The intent is to:

Identify High-Risk Address Changes: Evaluate and score the risk associated with address change requests made over the phone, flagging those with high scores for further investigation.
Detect Unblocked Fraudulent UIDs: Identify cases where fraudulent UIDs, linked to mobile registrations and involved in ATO attacks, have not been appropriately blocked, ensuring these UIDs are flagged for agent review and action.

method:
The report encompasses two primary components:

Risk Scoring for Address Changes:

Assess the risk of fraudulent activity in address change requests made over the phone.
Generate a risk score for each request based on identified risk factors.
Flag high-risk requests for detailed investigation to confirm their legitimacy or detect fraudulent intent.
Flagging Unblocked Fraudulent UIDs:

Monitor mobile app registrations linked to specific UIDs.
Identify UIDs involved in ATO attacks where the associated fraudulent phone numbers have not been blocked.
Flag these UIDs for immediate review and blocking by agents.
