Create Base Phone Table	To establish a foundational dataset capturing recent phone number changes linked to potential account takeover scenarios.	Required to filter and record only those phone numbers associated with account takeovers where changes occurred within the last 7 days. This dataset will support further analysis and tracking.
Populate IP Table	To transfer relevant data from the base phone table to the IP table, setting the stage for integration with event registration data.	Ensures that the IP table is populated with accurate and timely data for subsequent linkage and analysis of event-related details.
Create ATO Registration Base Table	To identify and analyze new mobile app registrations that might be related to account takeover activities by correlating them with phone number changes.	Necessitates the creation of a dedicated table that combines event registration data with phone number changes to trace and flag suspicious activities effectively.
Flag and Prepare Data for Agent Review	To finalize the preparation of data by flagging significant changes and potential fraud indicators for agent intervention.	Facilitates the operational readiness of agents to review and act upon entries that have been flagged as needing attention, based on potential risk indicators.
