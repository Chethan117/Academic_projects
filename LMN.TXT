# Script Decisions Documentation

Continuing from the detailed process stages outlined earlier, this section focuses on the final steps where the scores calculated from `STAGE 5` to `STAGE 13` are evaluated against predefined referral criteria. These steps are crucial for updating operational processes based on the results of the risk assessment.

## Final Evaluation and Update Process

### Script Details

**Final Score Check and Referral Update**:
- **Objective:** This step involves comparing the accumulated risk scores against the referral score criteria, which are predefined based on historical data and risk management policies. The comparison takes place within the context of specific start and end dates that define the period during which the referral criteria are applicable.

- **Rationale:** The purpose of this comparison is to determine whether the scores associated with changes of address and other risk factors meet the thresholds that require further action, such as additional verification steps or flags for potential fraud. This step is vital for proactive risk management and ensuring the accuracy of customer data.

- **Operations:**
  - **Score Comparison:** The scores calculated in the earlier stages are reviewed against the referral scores. This involves:
    - Checking if the score meets or exceeds the thresholds set for referral.
    - Applying these checks within the specified start and end dates to ensure the data is timely and relevant.
  - **Criteria Update:** Based on the outcomes of the score comparisons, operational referral criteria may be updated. This includes:
    - Adjusting thresholds to optimize risk detection.
    - Modifying the referral process based on new insights and data trends observed from the scoring process.

- **Requirement:** Accurate and timely evaluation of scores against referral criteria is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the operational processes. These checks ensure that all necessary actions are taken in response to potential risks, and that the referral criteria remain aligned with current risk landscapes and regulatory requirements.
