# Script Decisions Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive script implementations from STAGE 5 to STAGE 13, detailing each stage's role in processing and evaluating the risk associated with changes of address made via phone calls. The operations focus on extracting and analyzing various data points to assign risk scores based on predefined criteria.

## Script Decisions

### Script Details

**STAGE 5 to STAGE 13**:
- **Objective:** These stages are designed to fetch and process data such as active account numbers, card numbers, and various status codes like security fraud status, closed reason, charge-off reason, and credit revoke status. The stages also determine the method of event based on various conditions including VRU call ID presence, operator IDs, and screen IDs, which help categorize events into mobile application usage, OAS interactions, back office activities, and automated updates.

- **Rationale:** The intricate logic applied across these stages aims to precisely categorize and evaluate each account's risk based on recent changes made through customer interactions. For example, if a VRU call ID is not null and specific operator and screen IDs match, the event is categorized under mobile applications; if VRU call ID is null and specific job descriptions match, it's categorized under back office activities. Additionally, conditions are checked to categorize events as automated updates or other types, based on operator IDs.

- **Risk Scoring:**
  - **Credit Limit Score:** Accounts are scored based on the credit limit:
    - CL >= 4K: Score 5
    - CL >= 2K: Score 3
    - CL >= 1K: Score 1
    - Below 1K: Score 0
  - **Money Available Limit Score:**
    - More than 3K: Score 5
    - At least 2K: Score 3
    - At least 1K: Score 1
    - Below 1K: Score 0
  - **Address Matching Score:**
    - Outward postal codes from and to don’t match and area postal from and to don’t match: Score 5
    - Outward from and to don’t match but area from and to matches: Score 1

- **Requirement:** These detailed analyses and scoring mechanisms are crucial for assessing the risk associated with each change of address, helping identify potential fraud and ensuring the integrity of account information. The scores help in prioritizing follow-up actions and enhancing customer service strategies based on risk levels.
