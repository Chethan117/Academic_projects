Background (Why):
Address changes and mobile app registrations are two critical points where fraudsters can attempt account takeover (ATO) or identity theft. By combining the monitoring of both phone-based address changes and mobile app registrations, we can create a more comprehensive fraud detection system. This consolidated approach allows us to identify potential fraud patterns across multiple channels, enhancing our ability to protect customers and prevent unauthorized account access.
Intent (What):
The consolidated report aims to:

Identify high-risk address changes made over the phone
Detect potentially fraudulent mobile app registrations
Flag user IDs associated with suspicious activities that require blocking
Provide a unified view of potential fraud attempts across both channels
Streamline the investigation process for fraud prevention teams


Method (How):

Address Change Risk Scoring:

Analyze address changes made via phone
Apply risk scoring algorithm to each change
Flag high-risk address changes for further investigation


Mobile App Registration Analysis:

Monitor new mobile app registrations
Link each registration to a specific User ID (UID)
Identify patterns of fraudulent phone numbers linked to UIDs


Cross-Channel Correlation:

Compare high-risk address changes with suspicious mobile registrations
Identify any overlapping phone numbers or addresses across both channels
User ID Blocking Status Check:

For all flagged fraudulent User IDs, verify blocking status
Highlight any fraudulent User IDs that have not been blocked as required


Consolidated Reporting:

Generate a single report combining all findings
Include risk scores for address changes
List potentially fraudulent mobile registrations
Provide a summary of User IDs requiring immediate blocking
Highlight any cross-channel fraud patterns detected


Prioritized Action Items:

Rank fraud risks based on severity and cross-channel correlation
Provide clear recommendations for immediate actions (e.g., blocking specific User IDs, investigating high-risk address changes)



By consolidating these two reports, we create a more robust fraud detection process that covers multiple entry points for potential account takeover attempts. 
This approach allows fraud prevention teams to have a comprehensive view of suspicious activities enabling more efficient investigations and quicker response times to protect customers' accounts.
